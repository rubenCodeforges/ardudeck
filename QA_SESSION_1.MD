### HOTTER THEN SUN

### CRITICAL
- [ ] APM2.5 Telemetry dead , does not work
- [ ] exiting cli on inav and similar (disconnect or other disruption), will leave the board stuck in cli mode and it will be impossible to reconnect to it unless (power off real board or kill sitl)
- [ ] Mavlink boards (apm2.5) some presets in params do not work or have no indication that something has changed.
- [ ] Retinvestigate legacy board components.
### MEDIUM
- [ ] it would be cool to have a quick way to configure stabilization function and bind it to a mode switch. (maybe a wizzard ?) should but not deviate from design and layout. for all platforms.
- [ ] Params screen for apm2.5 and other mavlink boards are behind the inav , lacking many tabs that inav and betaflight have

### TRIVIAL
- [ ] pressing arrow up in cli adds a suffix to the previous command (special chars)
- [ ] still ocurences of electron icons are appearing , for example system alert() ETC.
- [ ] on mac the app in tray has Electron name , not ardudeck. maybe other os same.
